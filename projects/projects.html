            <p>HealthAlert is a health wearable and app tailored to the elderly, people with dangerous health conditions, 
                and people who suffer from memory loss. Many of our grandparents or parents may live alone, and their safety 
                is our first priority. As people get older, they are more susceptible to dangerous health conditions and 
                memory loss. HealthAlert helps them take care of themselves in different environments, like hot or humid 
                climates, and immediately alert close family members through SMS if the wearable detects alarming events, 
                like a seizure or fall.</p>
            <p>See the Github repository linked above (Github icon) or watch the video below to learn about HealthAlert's
                full capabilities.

            <p>I worked on creating and programming the physical device, sending/receiving data between the app and the Arduino through Bluetooth 
                low energy, and training a model to classify between seizure-like tremors and normal movement.

            <p>Draw Your Way is a mobile and web app that allows users to use 2D objects and the 
                drawing feature to guide friends and strangers alike through buildings, campuses, and cities. 
                The app allows users to create a simple visual guide then share it by copying and sending
                a simple code, making it the perfect guiding aid.</p>

                Trick-or-Treat Near Me! is a web and mobile app that uses Google Map's geolocation APIs 
                for users to find locations near them that are giving out candy and instructions for 
                socially-distanced trick-or-treating.
                Using the app, families can see nearby locations that are giving out candy on a map. 
                They can see locations that are offering peanut-free, gluten-free, etc. candy for 
                children with allergies, as well as instructions for socially-distanced and safe ways 
                to pick up candy. These locations and information are added by users, either those who 
                are giving out the candy or people who passed by the location while trick-or-treating 
                and want to share the location with others. The functionalities of the app are targeted 
                towards helping families plan trick-or-treating routes so that their children can have 
                the best experience.

            <p>Visionary is a Chrome extension that can change the way you study and read articles. 
                It is designed to help the elderly, dyslexic, and those who have difficulty focusing,
                but it can be used by anyone who wants to read articles efficiently. It can remove hyperlinks 
                and images, as well as change the font, text size, and text spacing of the whole website. 
                Using "Text to Senses" mode, if users highlight a certain word while using Visionary, 
                they can instantly receive an image that represents the word and hear a pronunciation of it.
                Users can also highlight text and download a text file of their highlighted notes.

                library, to create a parallax scrolling effect.
