        <h2>PCB Design</h2>
        <p>For my ECE Discovery Studio course, I embarked on an Individual Discovery Projects
          to explore the field of ECE. Since I had more experience with software and programming
          in the past, I wanted to try something new, so I decided to pick up skills in PCB
          design and fabrication. 
        </p>
        <p>During my first semester at Georgia Tech, I attended workshops at The Hive, an 
          ECE makerspace at Georgia Tech, to learn how to fabricate PCBs. I learned how to use
          about the entire fabrication process, from plotting to electroplating, with the following
          equipment: LPKF ProtoMat S103 (“PCB plotter”), LPKF ProtoLaser U4 (“PCB laser”), and
          PKF Contac S4 (“PCB electroplater”). 
        </p>
        <p>  
          I also followed tutorials to learn how to use EAGLE to design PCBs. The first PCB I learned to 
          design was a 2-layer "blinky board" PCB, with two LEDs that blink back and forth using a 555
          timer. With the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno">Jeremy Blum's YouTube tutorials</a>, I 
          first made a schematic of the circuit, then designed the board layout.
        </p>

          </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        I had no experience with designing PCBs before, so I was able to gain a lot of knowledge from the tutorials. 
        I started with learning the basic structure/material composition of a PCB and how it works. 
        I learned about the materials within PCBs, the different layers of PCBs, and how vias allow for connections between layers.
        Then, I learned 
        how to use software to draw a schematic. This includes loading a library of footprints into EAGLE, choosing 
        the right footprints, adding names and values to the parts, and naming unconnected wires to connect them. For 
        the PCB layout, I learned about the different layers of the PCB, creating ground and power buses, adding vias,
         ratsnest and auto-routing functions in EAGLE, and manual routing. I also learned how to run EAGLE’s Design Rule 
         Check to ensure that a PCB is ready for manufacturing. Finally, I learned how to generate a bill of materials 
         for the PCB components, as well as gerber files for fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>To practice using EAGLE, I converted a breadboard circuit of a 4-state finite state machine (FSM) that 
        I made for one of my classes into a PCB design. 
      </p>
      <p>The two images below show the original FSM diagram, FSM state table, and breadboard circuit I made for one of 
        my Digital System Design labs. The FSM is implemented in the circuit using a D-type flip flop IC, a 3-by-8 decoder IC, 
        and a NAND gate IC. Digital I/O reading and writing is controlled by an external data acquisition device.</p>

      <img src="att/fsm4.jpg" style="width:90%">
      <p>Below is the circuit implemented as an EAGLE schematic and PCB design. A battery is used to provide
        power/signal. A sliding switch is used to control the input for
        the FSM, LEDs are used to indicate the current state ID, and a button switch is used to simulate each clock cycle.</p>

        </tr>

          Next semester, I plan to design my own PCB project and fabricate my own PCB at The Hive.

        <h2>Arduino Projects</h2>
        <h3>Temperature Sensor</h3>
        <p>I built a waterproofed temperature sensor using a TMP36 thermistor and Arduino Nano.
            I soldered the thermistor onto wires and covered the thermistor and its connecting
            wires with conformal coating to waterproof the sensor so that it could be tested in 
            water. Then, I calibrated the sensor by recording its readings in water with 
            varying temperatures to obtain data points that allowed me to find a least-squares equation
            relating voltage and temperature. I also added LEDs to indicate different temperature ranges.
            This was my first time using Arduino and a breadboard, and I really enjoyed the project.
