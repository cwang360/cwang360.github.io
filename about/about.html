        <h1>About</h1> 
        <hr>
        <p>
            My name is Cynthia Wang, and I'm a first year student at Georgia Tech working on a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.
            I am currently interested in a summer internship in software engineering or digital system design related
            roles to expand my skillset.
            I have had several years of coding experience, through courses as well as projects, competitions, and programs
            including Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. I have also had biomedical engineering
            research experience and developed great communication skills presenting a poster at the annual
            Orthopaedic Research Society conference in February. Currently, I am part of the Systematic Project Organization Team in the Medical Robotics club
            at Georgia Tech, working on developing a standardized documentation system for the club's subteams.
        </p>
        <p> I'm currently located in Atlanta, Georgia, but I'm from suburban 
            Delaware. Fun facts about me: I enjoy gardening, listening to classical music, crocheting, and solving Sudoku puzzles. </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Currently, I'm a first-year student at <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b>, studying <b>Computer 
            Engineering</b>. I plan on specializing in the <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/distributed-system-software-design">Distributed System & Software Design</a> thread and 
            the <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/computing-hardware-emerging-architectures-thread">Computing Hardware & Emerging Architectures</a>
             thread. My projected graduation is December 2023.</p>
        <p>Relevant Courses I've taken: Fundamentals of Digital System Design,
            Comp. Hardware & Operation, Principles/Practice of Information Security</p>
        <p>I graduated from MOT Charter High School in May 2020.</p>
        
        <!-- <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn new skills in the field of Computer Engineering
            so that I can discover what I would like to do in my future. Although I do not have a specific
            career path in mind yet, I am considering software engineering or working with embedded systems.
            I plan on taking more electives in my threads and participating in extracurriculars and research 
            to learn about what I enjoy and explore new fields.

        <h2>Experience and Activities</h2>

        <h3>Technical Activities and Accomplishments</h3>

        <p>
            I'm currently part of the Systematic Project Organization Team (SPOT) of the Medical Robotics club
            at Georgia Tech. We are developing a standardized documentation system for the robotic solutions for 
            disabilities, such as exoskeletons and prosthetics. 
        </p>
	<p>
            I'm also part of the Grand Challenges Living/Learning Community, and my team is developing a solution
            to help reduce downstream food waste in the United States. We have analyzed the stakeholders of the problem space
            and mapped out the system that affects food waste. We have detailed this process in our 
            <a href="https://medium.com/gcpm10">Medium publication</a>. Now, we are looking at points of intervention and
            brainstorming solutions that will both satisfy consumers and make an impact by reducing food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2020, I attended Google's Computer Science Summer Institute, during which I
            completed an introductory project-based JavaScript processing curriculum taught by Google engineers.
            I also attended product design, resume development, and interview workshops. Throughout the program,
            I configured 10 individual coding projects, as well as a collaborative final project involving an 
            interactive weather visualizer that uses geolocation and weather APIs. 
        </p>
        <p>I was a part of the American Computer Science League in my junior and senior years of high school.
            I used Python and self-taught CS concepts (Boolean algebra, data structures, recursive functions, 
            digital electronics, bit-string flicking, etc.) to participate in short answer and coding competitions.
            I earned a perfect score on the second and fourth contests, as well as an overall first place in the 
            Delaware Intermediate/Senior Divisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2019, I participated in the Generation Tech Event held by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 
            I collaboratively designed an app for Nemours to help children with autism become accustomed to 
            unfamiliar places through social stories before going to the hospital. Our team pitched the app 
            idea to a panel of judges and won first place.

        </p>
        <p>
            I've also learned several new technical skills, such as rapid prototyping and app development with Flutter, by attending 
            hackathons. My hackathon projects are shown on the <a href="../projects/projects.html">projects page</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>
            As the Treasurer and Vice President of Operations of my high school Technology Student Association (TSA) 
            chapter, I managed bi-weekly chapter meetings and registration for events. I also helped reduce
             club fees from $150 to $85 by managing budget to reduce cost of materials by 40% and working with school administration.
             This made our club much more accessible to students, allowing us to see a significant increase in membership.
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
            Over my summers during high school, I conducted guided research on potential treatments for 
            osteoarthritis by investigating the effects of antioxidants on cartilage under inflammatory 
            attack. I used MATLAB to analyze calcium signaling data, and I used a click chemistry technique
            to track the loss of load-bearing and shock-absorbing components from cartilage extracellular matrix.
            I authored several abstracts that were accepted for annual Orthopaedic Research Society meetings,
            and I presented a poster at the 2020 meeting in Phoenix.
